Word analyzer is a program for sorting and counting words from the text file.

The goal is achived by reading the file one string at a time, transforming it to a lower case and then storing it into thre red-black tree. In case word has been encountered before, only it's appearance count is progressed.

The result is a text file listing all the words with a count which is produced by a traversal through binary tree.

The solution is written in Fortran for school project.
