Word analyzer is program for sorting and counting words from text file.
The goal is achived by reading file one string at a time, transforming it to lower case and then storing it into red-black tree. In the case word has beencountered before, only it's appearance count is progressed.
The result is text file listing all words with count which is produced by traversal through binary tree.
The solution is written in Fortran for school project.
